Advanced Weather Forecasting through Cutting-Edge Machine Learning Models
Welcome to our groundbreaking project on weather forecasting, where we harness the power of advanced machine learning algorithms to predict temperature trends. In this innovative initiative, we employ sophisticated techniques such as linear regression, random forest regression, and decision tree regression to provide accurate and nuanced predictions. Our model takes into account a myriad of factors, including maximum and minimum temperatures, cloud cover, humidity, sun hours, precipitation, pressure, and wind speed.

Unlocking the Potential of Machine Learning Algorithms
In the realm of temperature prediction, we transcend traditional methods by utilizing regression and functional regression algorithms. To achieve this, we leverage a comprehensive dataset, dedicating 80% for training and reserving 20% for testing. For instance, in forecasting the temperature for Kanpur, India, we utilize 8 years of historical data for training and 2 years for testing. This approach distinguishes our project from conventional weather forecasting methods, incorporating artificial intelligence to enhance accuracy through models like linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression.

Machine learning has revolutionized weather forecasting, offering unprecedented accuracy and predictability. Looking ahead, we anticipate even greater strides in leveraging these technologies to prevent disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms.

Methodology: Harnessing Data for Precision
Our dataset, sourced from Kaggle's "Historical Weather Data for Indian Cities," focuses specifically on Kanpur City. This meticulously collected dataset spans over a decade, from 01-01-2009 to 01-01-2020, offering a wealth of hourly weather data. While we acknowledge that data accuracy cannot be guaranteed, we emphasize the dataset's potential for visualizing climate change due to global warming and forecasting weather patterns for days, weeks, months, and seasons.

In this project, we spotlight the temperature prediction for Kanpur, employing diverse machine learning algorithms and regressions. The historical weather dataset enables us to employ multiple linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. Visual representations showcase the impact of global warming on factors like precipitation, humidity, and temperature.
